# Flight-Optimizer

API to help users pick their air flight travel through this (ficticious) large companyâ€™s search engine. 

Air travel is modeled as a network graph, where different flights travel between two different airports or cities. 
Each flight is owned and operated by an airline carrier. 
Users care about traveling between airports, but different users may have different perceptions of what makes a best flight based on their desires and limitations, such as time and money. 
These considerations make the graph weighted, such as distance, probability of cancelations, and flight cost.
